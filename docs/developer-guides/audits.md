# Audits 

Trivial-API leverages the [Audited gem](https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited) to log and monitor alterations across models. These alterations are logged into a dedicated `audits` table.

## Audits Overview

### Actions Tracked
Any `Create`, `Delete`, or `Update` actions performed on objects from the models tracked are documented within the audits table.

### Models Tracked
Changes made to objects with the following models are monitored:
- **App**
- **Credential Sets**
- **Manifest**
- **Manifest Draft**
- **Organization**
- **Org Role**
- **Permission**
- **Tags**
- **User**

### Models Not Tracked
Changes made to objects within an activity entry model are not monitored.

### Note on `user_id`:

The `user_id` column in each audit entry provides information about the user responsible for a change. This column is populated when a user signs in and is typically filled in for all audit entries. However, there's a specific scenario where the `user_id` is left blank â€“ when a user accepts an invitation. This behavior is expected as accepting an invitation doesn't require a user to sign in or undergo authentication.

**To identify the `user_id` of an accepted invitation:**

1. Look for audit entries with `auditable_type` column set to `OrgRole` and `action` column set to `create`. These entries indicate the acceptance of an invitation.
2. Once you've located the entry related to invitation acceptance, access the `audited_changes` column. Within this column, you'll find the `user_id` of the individual who accepted the invitation.


## Interacting with Audits via Console

The Audited gem allows users to retrieve relevant information in regards to model changes. Here are two commands available to use.

::: tip
To access the console, type the following: `bundle exec rails c`
:::

::: code-group
``` [Command]
user = User.find(1)
user.audits.last
user.audits.count
```
