# Getting Started

We've made it easy to get started with Trivial. Here's how:


1. Sign up for a free account at [trivialapps.io](https://www.trivialapps.io/register).

2. Connect a sales channel (Shopify, Square, etc.) or upload a CSV.

3. Review your sales and re-run the importer as many times as you like to customize how fields import.

4. Map your sales data to your accounting system and schedule imports.
