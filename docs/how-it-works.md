# How Trivial Works

Trivial sits between your WMS and your accounting system, listening for billable events. As warehouse activity happens, Trivial processes the event according to the customer's contract.

At the interval you specify, Trivial generates invoices and sends them to your customer, complete with back-up data. Trivial also sends the invoice data to your accounting system for reconciliation.
