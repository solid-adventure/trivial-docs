# Audits 

Trivial-API leverages the [Audited gem](https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited) to log and monitor alterations across models. Any Create, Delete, or Update actions performed on Objects are documented within the `audits` table.

</div>

### Note on `user_id`:

The `user_id` column in each audit entry provides information about the user responsible for a change within an object. This column is populated when a user signs in and is typically filled in for all audit entries. However, there's a specific scenario where the `user_id` is left blank â€“ when a user accepts an invitation. This behavior is due to the fact that accepting an invitation doesn't require a user to sign in or undergo authentication. 

To uncover the `user_id` associated with an accepted invitation, we recommend identifying the audit entry linked to the creation of an `OrgRole`. You can pinpoint this entry by looking for a blank or null `user_id`, along with the `CREATE` value in the `action` column and the `OrgRole` value in `autible_type` column. Once you've located this entry, a quick check of the `audit_changes` column will unveil the `user_id` of the user who accepted the organization invitation


## Interacting with Audits via Console

The Audited gem allows users to retrieve relevant information in regards to model changes. Here are two commands available to use.

::: tip
To access the console, type the following: `bundle exec rails c`
:::

::: code-group
``` [Command]
user = User.find(1)
user.audits.last
user.audits.count
```
