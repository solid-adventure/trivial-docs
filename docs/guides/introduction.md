# Use Cases

Trivial provides generic tooling to receive, modify, and relay event notifications.

This could be used to:
- Calculate charges as work is performed
- Relay updates from a webstore (e.g. Shopify) to a database (Postgres)
- Query a database in response to a dashboard load

To see how a Trivial application works, see the [WMS Billing Walkthrough](/guides/wms-billing).
